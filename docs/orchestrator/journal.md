# Orchestrator journal

Append-only log for the Specular workflow orchestrator (a scheduled Claude routine).
Each run reads the last ~5 entries before acting, then appends one entry at the bottom.

Write **insight**, not activity. "Surveyed 8 PRs, triaged 2" is noise. "PRs in
`canvas-bg/entity-renderers/` keep needing a follow-up for keyboard handling —
worth a deepening proposal" is signal.

Format per entry:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD
Surveyed: <one line — what you looked at and the dominant theme>
Acted:
- <#issue/PR or path> — <what + why>
Noticed (no action): <patterns worth watching>
Hint for next run: <one sentence for tomorrow-you>
```

## 2026-05-10 (seed)
Surveyed: nothing yet — first run, system being set up.
Notes: scope clarified — orchestrator watches the *automation system*, not the product. Output is proposals to improve the system (skills, prompts, labels, habits), not actions inside the system. Operating skills already in place: `/triage`, `/to-issues`, `/to-prd`, `/grill-with-docs`, `/improve-codebase-architecture`.
Hint for next run: on first real run, baseline the system. Count merged PRs in the last week, what fraction came via the AFK pipeline, current `needs-triage` and `ready-for-agent` queue depths, and when the skills directory was last touched. That snapshot is what future runs compare against to spot leaks.

## 2026-05-10 (first real run)
Surveyed: 30 merged PRs, Lyle's commit log, queue depths, CI state, skills history. Dominant theme: establishing baseline.
Acted:
- #61 — CI check for SKILL.md drift (three observed instances of manual sync: April repair commit, May-06 skills-only touch, May-08 rename sweep). Smallest fix: a diff gate in CI.
- #63 — CI workflow proposal (typecheck + test:unit + SKILL.md diff). Explicitly absorbs #61. Two instances of Lyle manually noting "typecheck + test:unit pass" in commit messages.
- #62, #64 — journal PRs filed (duplicate; the run fired twice, producing two PRs for the same date — a self-failure)
Noticed (no action): /simplify being invoked at the tail of most PRs (pattern in commit messages). AFK pipeline at 0/12 PRs — same as the seed hint predicted.
Hint for next run: check whether #61 was closed when #63 superseded it; check AFK fraction; watch for journal PR accumulation.

## 2026-05-11
Surveyed: AFK pipeline fraction (14 merged PRs week-to-date), needs-triage staleness (issue #53, 2 days old), orchestrator proposal status.
Acted:
- #68 — AFK habit gap proposal. Lyle's flow is idea → interactive Claude session → PR; zero issues routed through /triage → ready-for-agent. Two instances: 0/14 AFK fraction + empty ready-for-agent queue. Proposed a one-sentence routing heuristic added to /to-issues.
- #69 — journal PR filed.
Noticed (no action): #61 still open alongside #63 (not closed after being superseded). ADR cadence high: 5 ADRs (0003–0007) in 5 days. SKILL.md was touched in the May-08 and May-10 PRs — skills keeping pace with domain changes, not a leak.
Hint for next run: check whether any of the three proposals (#61, #63, #68) have been acted on; if all three are still open and unreviewed, the bottleneck is review bandwidth, not automation gaps — note it and don't add more proposals.

---

## 2026-05-12
Surveyed: Journal PR accumulation and proposal review status. Three journal PRs (#62, #64, #69) open unmerged; three proposals (#61, #63, #68) open unreviewed. needs-triage: 1 item (issue #53, now 4 days old). ready-for-agent: 0. AFK fraction: still 0/14+.
Acted:
- Filed self-modifying proposal (see issue below) — orchestrator creates one journal PR per run, causing PRs to pile up rather than stacking. Proposed: detect open journal PRs before filing a new one; add to the same branch instead of opening a second.
- Filed this consolidated journal entry covering 2026-05-10 (first real run), 2026-05-11, and 2026-05-12.
Noticed (no action): The system is producing output (proposals, journal PRs) faster than it is being reviewed. This is not an automation failure — the orchestrator is working. It is a human-bandwidth constraint. Adding more proposals into an unreviewed queue adds noise. Correct response: hold until existing proposals are actioned.
Hint for next run: if proposals #61, #63, #68 are still all open with no comments, write "why is nothing landing?" into the journal rather than proposing again. The answer is more useful than another proposal.

## 2026-05-13
Surveyed: Proposal review status, AFK pipeline fraction (PRs #74–#80 merged today), issue queue, housekeeping debt. Dominant theme: the AFK pipeline activated overnight; the concern in #68 self-corrected.
Acted:
- #61 closed — superseded by #63 since 2026-05-10 but never closed. Pending housekeeping debt settled.
- #71 closed — journal PR stacking fix is now implemented in the orchestrator's own prompt ("Journal PR mechanics" section). The pre-flight check this run found no open journal PR and correctly opened a single new one.
Noticed (no action):
- **AFK pipeline is live.** PR #76 (keyboard binding registry, dex epic `ypz5rro1`) merged today with 5 step PRs (#75, #77, #78, #79, #80) — all produced by the AFK agent in under 8 hours. AFK fraction flipped from 0/14 to a full epic overnight. The gap #68 described was real during the architectural sprint; it self-corrected once a bounded, well-specified plan (#74) existed.
- **Proposals #63 and #68 have zero comments and zero activity.** Asking "why?" yields a different answer than before: #68's gap has now closed on its own, so the proposal is likely moot. #63 (CI workflow) is the only live proposal. It requires adding one YAML file — that is agent-executable. It has never been labeled `ready-for-agent`, which means it has no path through the pipeline that just proved itself capable of delivering a 5-step refactor overnight.
- **Issue #81 filed today** — 5-phase test coverage plan. Each phase is bounded and has clear acceptance criteria. A natural candidate for the AFK pipeline once Phase 0 (decisions) is answered in comments.
- **Issue #53** (`needs-triage`) is now 4 days old and still unrouted. Pattern: bugs that require architectural discussion (it is) park here indefinitely.
Hint for next run: check if #63 has been labeled `ready-for-agent`; if not, that is the only systemic gap worth watching — a CI workflow addition is exactly the kind of bounded task the pipeline can absorb.
