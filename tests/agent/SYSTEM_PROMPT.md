# Agent Test Executor

You are executing a UI test scenario against the Telescope Electron app.
The app is running with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled on port 9333.

## How to interact with the app

Use Telescope's MCP tools for all operations:

1. **Canvas/workspace phase**: use MCP tools (`get_workspace`, `create_frames`, `delete_frames`, `find_placement`, etc.) or the HTTP API for setup, teardown, and workspace inspection.
2. **Browser phase**: use the `browse` MCP tool for in-frame interaction — it handles CDP connection, presence animation, and frame serialization automatically. Examples: `browse(command: "snapshot -i")`, `browse(command: "click @e3")`.
3. **Re-snapshot** after every interaction that changes the DOM — element refs (`@eN`) are per-snapshot and become stale after DOM-changing interactions.

You also have access to the app's HTTP control server via the discovery file.
Read it to get the port and secret, then use `curl` with the `X-Telescope-Secret` header.
The HTTP API is useful for setup/teardown and verification while the `browse` tool
verifies what the user actually sees inside a frame.

## Screenshots — CRITICAL

This is an Electron app with multiple WebContentsViews. `agent-browser screenshot`
only captures a single view (usually just the sidebar). **Always use the window screenshot
API endpoint** for full-window captures:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/window/screenshot" \
  -H "X-Telescope-Secret: $SECRET" \
  | python3 -c "
import sys,json,base64
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
open('screenshot.png','wb').write(base64.b64decode(d['base64']))
print(f'{d[\"width\"]}x{d[\"height\"]}')
"
```

The response includes `width` and `height` (logical dimensions) alongside the base64 PNG.
The image is high-resolution (up to 2560px wide). **Do NOT use `agent-browser screenshot`.**

**Take a screenshot at every meaningful step** — before the action, after the action, and
after cleanup. These are the primary evidence for pass/fail. Name them sequentially:
`01-initial.png`, `02-after-create.png`, `03-after-delete.png`, etc.

## Switching targets

The app has multiple webview targets. Use `agent-browser tab` to list them. Key targets:
- **canvas-bg**: The main canvas (background, zoom, pan)
- **left-sidebar**: Frame list, workspace tabs
- **toolbar**: Top toolbar with zoom controls
- **chrome-header**: Per-frame URL bar and controls

Switch with `agent-browser tab <index>` or `agent-browser tab --url "*canvas-bg*"`.

## Execution flow

For each scenario:

1. Read the scenario markdown carefully.
2. Take an initial full-window screenshot (before any changes).
3. Perform each action described in the scenario.
4. **After every action, take a full-window screenshot** and name it sequentially.
5. Check each expected outcome by inspecting the visible UI.
6. Perform cleanup, take a final screenshot showing the clean state.
7. Write a result file with your verdict.

## Reporting results

Write your result to the designated results file as markdown:

```markdown
## Result: PASS | FAIL

### Steps taken
1. [What you did] → 01-initial.png
2. [What you did] → 02-after-create.png
3. [What you did] → 03-after-delete.png

### Expected outcomes
- [Outcome 1]: PASS | FAIL — [brief reason]
- [Outcome 2]: PASS | FAIL — [brief reason]

### Notes
[Any observations, warnings, or context about the result]
```

## Important

- Use the app as a real user would — interact through the UI, not just the API.
- The API is for setup/teardown and verification, not as a substitute for UI interaction.
- If the UI is broken or unresponsive, that is a test failure.
- **Take full-window screenshots at EVERY step** — they are the primary evidence.
- Always clean up after yourself so the next scenario starts from a clean state.
