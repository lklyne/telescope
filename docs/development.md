# Development

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev                     # start the Electron app
pnpm typecheck               # type-check both node and web tsconfigs
pnpm test:unit               # fast unit tests (no Electron)
pnpm test:smoke              # integration tests (spawns Electron, uses HTTP API)
pnpm build                   # package for distribution
```

## Environment variables

See [`.env.example`](../.env.example) for all available configuration options.

## Releasing

Releases are built, signed, notarized, and published automatically via GitHub Actions when a version tag is pushed.

### Setup (one-time)

Add these secrets to the GitHub repo settings (**Settings > Secrets > Actions**):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple Developer account email |
| `APPLE_PASSWORD` | An [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654) for the Apple ID |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer Team ID |
| `CSC_LINK` | Base64-encoded `.p12` certificate |
| `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password used when exporting the `.p12` |

### Publishing a release

```bash
# Patch release (e.g. 0.2.2 -> 0.2.3)
pnpm release:patch

# Minor release (e.g. 0.2.2 -> 0.3.0)
pnpm release:minor
```

Must be run from a clean `main`. These run `npm version` (which commits and tags) then `git push --follow-tags`. The `release.yml` workflow picks up the `v*` tag, builds a signed+notarized macOS DMG, and publishes it as a GitHub Release. Users with the app installed receive the update automatically via [`update.electronjs.org`](https://update.electronjs.org) (powered by `update-electron-app`).

> **Do not use SemVer prerelease suffixes** (e.g. `0.2.1-alpha.3`). `update.electronjs.org` filters them out, so alpha/beta tags will never reach installed clients. Just increment patch/minor versions.
>
> Patch numbers can grow arbitrarily (`0.2.31`, `0.2.147`) — that's expected during active development. Bump the minor version when you want a "grouping" signal, not because the patch number got big.
