# Changelog

All notable changes to Specular will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Do not use prerelease suffixes (`-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`). `update.electronjs.org` filters based on GitHub's "prerelease" release flag (not the SemVer suffix), so tagged-alpha versions *can* reach clients — but mixing SemVer prerelease ordering with GitHub's flag is a footgun. Just increment patch/minor versions and keep releases as non-prereleases.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-14 — Shapes, Alignment Guides, Live Components

### New
- You can now add basic shapes like squares, circles, and diamonds with inner text to the canvas
- Added a highlighter brush in addition to pen
- Render local interactive HTML files to the canvas
- Connect a local repo and drop live component views onto the canvas (hot-reloads as you edit)
- Better markdown editing with CodeMirror — edit inline, styled view, file-type icons
- Improved settings panel with Skills, Fix, and keyboard Bindings management
- Alignment and spacing guides while you drag and resize
- Axis-locked drag with shift
- Option-drag to copy
- Resize multiple entities at once with a single bounding box
- Click a selected entity again to start editing it (text, stickies, files, drawings)
- Cmd+A selects everything on the canvas
- Paste a URL to drop a page, paste an image to drop a file, paste plain text to drop a sticky
- Click anywhere with the text tool to drop a text node and start typing
- New pages default to framed in a device shell
- Inspector got a richer tooltip and a Chrome-style box-model overlay
- Canvas grid fades smoothly across zoom levels and stays legible when zoomed out
- Press p/t/s/r/o/i/m to switch tools

### Behavior changes
- Cmd+D drops the duplicate next to the source instead of wrapping both in a row group
- When a page has keyboard focus, native shortcuts (Cmd+Z, Cmd+G, arrows, tool keys) go to the page. Press Escape first to use canvas shortcuts.

### Fixes
- Edges are easier to grab when zoomed out — hit targets scale with zoom
- Cursor video recording captures at native resolution and includes the cursor
- Drawing strokes keep uniform width regardless of how fast you draw
- Sticky note resize and edit focus
- Marquee box renders above page content instead of getting clipped
- Cmd+D works on multi-selections and groups
- Hotkeys keep working even when a page has an autofocused input
- Wireframes survive malformed nodes instead of crashing
- App-menu DevTools opens for the focused view


## [0.2.7] - 2026-04-23 — Cursor Trails, Multi-Select

### New
- WebGPU particle trails behind agent cursors — speed-gated emission with noise-driven drift, so trails concentrate during fast movement and dissipate when idle
- Shift/Cmd-click toggles entities in and out of the current selection across frames, text, files, drawings, and groups

### Improvements
- Canvas zooms out to 2% (down from 10%), so huge spatial workspaces fit on screen
- Frames stay draggable when you click into one from a multi-selection

### Fixes
- Selected groups drag and resize cleanly under rapid input
- Shift/Cmd-click on a singly-selected frame now toggles selection instead of falling through to the webpage

### Misc
- Release skill documents the new two-commit flow (changelog, then version bump)

## [0.2.6] - 2026-04-21 — Presence Polish, Debug Window

Lots of refinement to how agent cursors move and retire, plus a new debug window for inspecting presence in flight.

### Improvements
- Agent cursors render in canvas space, so they no longer rubber-band during pan/zoom
- Cursor motion follows a Catmull-Rom spline with distance-scaled animation — short hops feel instant, long travel reads as intentional
- Scroll animates with an ease curve and dwells before moving, so the cursor lands at the origin before the page shifts
- Cursors fade out gracefully on idle-retire and session-done instead of popping
- Single-item creates, updates, and deletes across text, files, frames, links, groups, annotations, and camera focus all move the cursor now
- Each frame gets its own agent-browser session, so driving multiple frames in one app session routes to the right place
- `specular link <fromId> <toId>` accepts positional args alongside the stdin batch form

### Fixes
- Click timing: the cursor actually arrives before mousePressed lands, with a full travel+dwell window
- Agent cursor projections account for chrome height, so clicks no longer land 44px above their target
- Same-frame attach_frame no longer bounces the cursor to frame center
- Unresolvable click/fill refs no longer snap to frame center
- Sidebar inline edit layout
- Presence sessions refresh `lastSeenAt` on lookup, so active flows can't be reaped mid-sweep

### New
- Standalone debug window with a presence timeline and motion playground

### Misc
- LICENSE file (PolyForm Shield 1.0.0)
- Expanded README with feature list, install instructions, and MCP docs
- CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and SECURITY docs
- `.env.example` covering available environment variables
- Specular skill moved into the repo so branch edits stop leaking globally
- Internal planning docs moved to `docs/internal/`
